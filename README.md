# Maze Interpreter (C)

A C++ version of my [Python Maze Interpreter](http://github.com/olls/maze-interpreter-v2). Written in basic C++ / pure C, with a bit of help from SDL for the window and pixelbuffer.


# Planned Specs

ATM aiming to be able deal with mazes 10000 x 10000 cell; at 32 bits per cell, equals 400MB in memory.
